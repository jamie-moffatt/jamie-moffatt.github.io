## About Me

### Biography
I joined the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex as a PhD student in September 2018.

The aim of my research project is to develop methods of inducing anomalous experiences, such as dissociation and hallucinations, that are similar to those experienced in psychosis. This will allow us to assess individual differences that influence how individuals experience and interpret anomalous experiences. In particular, we are interested in how individual differences in interoception and metacognition are involved in these experiences. This will hopefully contribute to the development of intervention approaches to address unhelpful thinking styles that can co-occur with these experiences and lead to distress and dysfunction.

Prior to my PhD studies, I worked for two years as a research assistant on the Hearing the Voice Project, an interdisciplinary study of voice-hearing experiences, where I helped to coordinate and conduct research investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice-hearing.

I studied Psychology and Psychological Research at the University of Birmingham, where I graduated with a Master in Science in July 2016.
