**Moffatt, J. (2022).** Bodily Sensations During Voice-Hearing Experiences. Voices in Psychosis: Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

  In this invited book chapter, I reflect on experiences of voice-hearing described by people with psychosis, and highlight how frequently they involve bodily sensations, including dissociative and emotive experiences. I go on to describe the study of interoception, which concerns the ability to sense internal sensations such as the beating of the heart, and posit that interoception may be a fruitful field of study for trying to understand voice-hearing and similar experiences.

### 2021

Chinchani, A. M., Menon, M., Roes, M., Hwang, H., Allen, P., **Moffatt, J.**, ... & Woodward, T. S. (2021). Item-specific overlap between hallucinatory experiences and cognition in the general population: A three-step multivariate analysis of international multi-site data. cortex, 145, 131-144.

Moseley, P., Aleman, A., Allen, P., Bell, V., Bless, J., **Moffatt, J.**, ... & Fernyhough, C. (2021). Correlates of hallucinatory experiences in the general population: An international multisite replication study. Psychological Science, 32(7), 1024-1037.

  In this multi-site international study led by Dr. Peter Moseley, we tested the replicability of the association between hallucinations and several cognitive processes, including source memory, signal detection and intentional inhibition. My role was to design and program the online experimental tasks using a mixture of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and SQL. These scripts were translated to French, Czech and Norwegian languages and used to collect data from multiple nations across the globe.


### 2020

**Moffatt, J.**, Mitrenga, K. J., Alderson-Day, B., Moseley, P., & Fernyhough, C. (2020). Inner experience differs in rumination and distraction without a change in electromyographical correlates of inner speech. PloS one, 15(9), e0238920.

  In this mixed-methods study, I found that when induced to experience a ruminative emotional state, their self-report of their own internal monologue (termed inner speech) became more rich and detailed, but this was not accompanied by changes subvocal muscle movements recorded with EMG
