## About Me
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, working in the [Lab of Action & Body](http://manostsakiris.com/index.php/research/lab/). My key research interest is in understanding the causes of dissociation - an often distressing set of experiences that can involve feeling detached from the self, the world, or other aspects of reality.

To study this, I design cognitive experiments both online and in the lab. Currently, I am developing studies to test how the sensing of internal bodily signals, such as the beating heart, contribute to dissociation. I also plan to explore how the pairing of sensations in time, such as paired visual and touch sensations, might be altered in people who report more dissociation.

I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Sussex in 2022, at the School of Psychology, University of Sussex. My PhD mainly explored how we can study dissociation in the lab, using techniques like augmented reality.

Prior to my PhD research, I worked for two years as a research assistant for the [Hearing the Voice](https://hearingthevoice.org/) project at Durham University. In this role I helped to conduct psychological research investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice-hearing experiences. I also studied Psychology and Psychological Research at the University of Birmingham, where I graduated with a Master in Science in July 2016.
