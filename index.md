## About Me
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, working in the Lab of Action & Body. My research covers interoception, multi-sensory integration and feelings of dissociation.

I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Sussex in 2022, at the School of Psychology, University of Sussex. My PhD explored perceptual mechanisms of dissociative experiences

Prior to my PhD research, I worked for two years as a research assistant for the <a href="https://hearingthevoice.org/">Hearing the Voice</a> project at Durham University. In this role I helped to conduct psychological research investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice-hearing experiences.

I also studied Psychology and Psychological Research at the University of Birmingham, where I graduated with a Master in Science in July 2016.
