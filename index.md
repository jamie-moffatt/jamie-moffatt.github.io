## About Me
I am currently an ESRC-funded Postdoctoral Fellow based in the Department of Psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London. I am interested in how our perception of the external world and of our own biological signals (our interoception) inform and construct the sense of our body and self. My research circumstances in which these senses break down; in Virtual Reality, where we can experience a body wholly different to our own, and in Dissociation, a set of transdiagnostic clinical experiences that can involve feeling detached from the self, the world, or other aspects of reality. 

After my PhD studies, I spent two years at the [Lab of Action & Body](http://manostsakiris.com/index.php/research/lab/) as a postdoctoral researcher studying how interoception, the sense of our internal bodily sensations such as the heartbeat influence the perception of ourselves and of others. 

I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Sussex in 2022, at the School of Psychology, University of Sussex. My PhD mainly explored how we can study dissociation in the lab, using techniques like augmented reality.

Before my PhD research I worked for two years as a research assistant for the [Hearing the Voice](https://hearingthevoice.org/) project at Durham University. In this role I helped to conduct psychological research investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice-hearing experiences. I also studied Psychology and Psychological Research at the University of Birmingham, where I graduated with a Master in Science in July 2016.
