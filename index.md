## About Me
My recent research aims to understand the cognitive, behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying unusual experiences that often occur in the context of psychosis, such as feelings of dissociation from oneself or from reality, or perceptions that have no real-world basis.

I am currently a PhD student at the School of Psychology, University of Sussex. My supervisors are Professor Kathryn Greenwood and Professor Sarah Garfinkel, and our project aims to study unusual experiences by developing methods of inducing unusual experiences in a safe and controlled manner in the lab. Through these methods we hope to understand more about what causes unusual experiences.

Prior to my PhD research, I worked for two years as a research assistant on the Hearing the Voice Project at Durham University. In this role I helped to conduct research investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice-hearing experiences.

My other research interests include coding and developing behavioural tasks for conducting psychology research online and using techniques such as EMG and ECG to measure biological correlates of behaviour.
